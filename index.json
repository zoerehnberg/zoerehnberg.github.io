[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"My research focuses on the application of statistics to problems in high-throughput biology. My main contributions have included novel methodology for processing and analyzing drug screening data from large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. In particular, these methods take into account the highly complex error structures of such data. I am also developing computationally efficient prediction algorithms for high-dimensional data that aim to make complex and iterative workflows feasible.\nCurrently, I am a sixth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I am completing my dissertation research under the supervision of Johann Gagnon-Bartsch.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://zoerehnberg.github.ioacademic-kickstart/author/zoe-l.-rehnberg/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/zoe-l.-rehnberg/","section":"authors","summary":"My research focuses on the application of statistics to problems in high-throughput biology.
